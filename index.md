- **_logging each message sent by an agent_**

Agents monitoring the routed chats sometimes pitch in statements to engange the visitor till the actual owner of the chat picks it up and once in a while, they are constrained to end the chat. The responses sent in the chat cannot be distinguished whether they were sent by the actual owner or the agent monitoring chats which ensue complications in Chat quality and handling reports (One of my chat reviewed were of such case; I did not handle the whole chat and it affected the overall rating). It would be better to add a functionality which can identify the reponses.
